In this project we not only did analysis but also got insights via drawing charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn. The video started with an objective that we need to analyse, how parents marital status education, outdor activities are affecting their scores.

By running df.describe we did high level analysis such as:
1) students are better in reading compared to writing.
2) Stuents match score is lesser compared  reading and writing score.
3) There  are students with scores 0/100 and as well as 100/100.
